# App-Building in Progress! 

# Neighborhood Bakes
A web app to find local/home bakers!

## Motivation/Goal
As a hobby baker, I have found myself connecting with other hobby bakers looking to sell their bakes. The problem? Exposure!

Most of the bakers I have talked to have social media accounts dedicated to their baking, with the most commonly mentioned apps being Instagram and TikTok. The problem with these apps are that, even if users post regularly, there is no guarantee that they will be feautred anywhere, stagnating their potential growth. 

With this app, bakers (from small business-bakeries or home bakers with the appropriate state licensure) can create accounts with their location, post their photots/videos, and market themselves. Customers can also create accounts, and find bakers in their area that would meet their needs. Business accounts will have the option of turning on direct messages so customers can reach out directly through the app. If the business keeps this functionality off, they will have a contact phone number and/or e-mail address available. 

## Technologies Used
The current plan is to build this app from scratch, using Python and Flask. For customer and business data storage, I will use SQLite3 while developing the app, and once ready for deployment, switch to a database that can handle a mass amount of data more strongly, like PostgreSQL with Amazon RDS. 

## Potential issues with building the app
This is my first web application that I am building completely from scratch. I am essentially learning as I build, especially HTML. This project will likely take a while to develop. 

Alongside the amount of time it will take, I am concerned about how much I will be able to create using Python/Flask alone, as JavaScript/React/C# are more commonly used for big projects like this

Stay tuned for updates!
